# Portfolio
##Purpose
This website is the initial draft for my future project portfolio.
In this version I added links to google as placeholders for future addition of links to my resume which will appear on a seperate HTML page and to my projects.
I was unsuccesful to completely fix media querie formating.  With continued practice I will tackle this again and add the needed fixes.
I also added the required hover options to my project images and linked the resume image to eventually lead to new page with my resume.
